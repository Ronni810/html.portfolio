<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey..I am Ronni , a simple suttle and soft hearted but mostly opposite of these.</br>
  I live in chennai,TN. My happy place will be my place for sure..cuz its greeny and gives a peaceful vibe. </br>
  The main note is that I am never a balanced person,a pure extremist.</p>

<p>Keeping things in my own way, physically a cup of green tea and mentally those ten repeative songs and movies or</br>
  a handfull time to spend with some homies.It's okay to accept some bad days , dull mindset and depressed heart </br>
  and to stay in room all-day to heal yourself.I always do believe in changing than accepting fate. I inspire people </br>
  having same vigour like me, who do things for what they like and want across all barriers and boundaries.</br>
  I brighten my spark everytime it gets faded and filling it's gleam around me.  </br>
  I am so starnge as a Beholder, I see and value things differently and will be happily stick on to it.</br>
  Lately, I have realised when some things are lost its lost forever and the only way is to try untill the last chance</br>
  to get it and preserve it for life.  </p>

<p>Enjoying the ups and downs of life with some stable souls, supporting me till now.Luckily I experienced the blessing</br>
   of God given gifts by some people in my life . Though Luck doesnt always favour , we need to strive hard.</br>
    Stay connected, A lot to go.. </p>
